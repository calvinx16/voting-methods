# Voting Methods Analysis

A behavioural data science project to compare voting methods common in social choice theory and the effects they have on the outcomes of the Eurovision Song Contest. This project implements and analyzes different voting methods using a simulated voter preference dataset.  

It also includes **bootstrap sampling** to statistically validate the stability of election outcomes.

Originally developed for my Thesis in 2022 as part of my Master's program and significantly refactored for professional portfolio presentation.

> Note: The project currently relies on local data files not included in the repo. Maybe in the future I will revisit to try to add back old data files or even try out more recent data :)
